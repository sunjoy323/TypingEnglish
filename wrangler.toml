# Optional D1 binding (required for /api/* in Workers mode).
# For open-source portability we don't hard-code your database id here.
# Bind `DB` via the Cloudflare dashboard, or uncomment and fill your own id.
# If you use Cloudflare Git integration, prefer `wrangler.with-db.toml` (uses `D1_DATABASE_ID` env var) to avoid losing bindings after redeploys:
#
# [[d1_databases]]
# binding = "DB"
# database_name = "typingenglish"
# database_id = "<YOUR_DATABASE_ID>"
#
# After adding the block above (locally), you can run:
# - Local:  `npm run db:migrate:local`
# - Remote: `npm run db:migrate:remote`
